FUNCTIONS
    count_records(filename, outfile=<_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'>)
        For debugging and analysis: summarise the file's BIFF records.
        ie: produce a sorted file of ``(record_name, count)``.
        
        :param filename: The path to the file to be summarised.
        :param outfile: An open file, to which the summary is written.
    
    dump(filename, outfile=<_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'>, unnumbered=False)
        For debugging: dump an XLS file's BIFF records in char & hex.
        
        :param filename: The path to the file to be dumped.
        :param outfile: An open file, to which the dump is written.
        :param unnumbered: If true, omit offsets (for meaningful diffs).
    
    inspect_format(path=None, content=None)
        Inspect the content at the supplied path or the :class:`bytes` content provided
        and return the file's type as a :class:`str`, or ``None`` if it cannot
        be determined.
        
        :param path:
          A :class:`string <str>` path containing the content to inspect.
          ``~`` will be expanded.
        
        :param content:
          The :class:`bytes` content to inspect.
        
        :returns:
           A :class:`str`, or ``None`` if the format cannot be determined.
           The return value can always be looked up in :data:`FILE_FORMAT_DESCRIPTIONS`
           to return a human-readable description of the format found.
    
    open_workbook(filename=None, logfile=<_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'>, verbosity=0, use_mmap=True, file_contents=None, encoding_override=None, formatting_info=False, on_demand=False, ragged_rows=False, ignore_workbook_corruption=False)
        Open a spreadsheet file for data extraction.
        
        :param filename: The path to the spreadsheet file to be opened.
        
        :param logfile: An open file to which messages and diagnostics are written.
        
        :param verbosity: Increases the volume of trace material written to the
                          logfile.
        
        :param use_mmap:
        
          Whether to use the mmap module is determined heuristically.
          Use this arg to override the result.
        
          Current heuristic: mmap is used if it exists.
        
        :param file_contents:
        
          A string or an :class:`mmap.mmap` object or some other behave-alike
          object. If ``file_contents`` is supplied, ``filename`` will not be used,
          except (possibly) in messages.
        
        :param encoding_override:
        
          Used to overcome missing or bad codepage information
          in older-version files. See :doc:`unicode`.
        
        :param formatting_info:
        
          The default is ``False``, which saves memory.
          In this case, "Blank" cells, which are those with their own formatting
          information but no data, are treated as empty by ignoring the file's
          ``BLANK`` and ``MULBLANK`` records.
          This cuts off any bottom or right "margin" of rows of empty or blank
          cells.
          Only :meth:`~xlrd.sheet.Sheet.cell_value` and
          :meth:`~xlrd.sheet.Sheet.cell_type` are available.
        
          When ``True``, formatting information will be read from the spreadsheet
          file. This provides all cells, including empty and blank cells.
          Formatting information is available for each cell.
